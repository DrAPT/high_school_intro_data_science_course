  - transforming data and building predictors by applying functions

  - understanding the data: visualization, summarization **[DS.10]†**  
    justify the design, use, and effectiveness of different forms of data visualizations and summarizations **[DS.6]**  
    building interactive dashboards

  - building and evaluating linear regression models  **[DS.9]†**  
    thinking critically about predictors: they should be intuitive and avoid bias

  - communicating data science with stakeholders: telling a compelling, clear, accurate story **[DS.5]†**  

- **Use Technology to Implement Data Science [DS.12]†**  
  Python Jupyter notebooks contain rich text, images, and code examples for interactive learning

## Data Science Standards in Virginia Public Schools

**DATA AND SOCIETY**  
- [DS.1]†  The student will identify specific examples of societal problems that can be effectively addressed using data science.
- [DS.2]	 The student will be able to formulate a top down plan for data collection and analysis based on the context of a problem.

**DATA AND ETHICS**  
- [DS.3]†  The student will recognize the importance of data literacy in global citizenship and develop an awareness of how the analysis of data can be used to affect positive changes and mitigate negative consequences.

- [DS.4]	 The student will be able to identify biases in the data collection process, and understand the basic ethical implications and privacy issues surrounding data collection.

**DATA AND COMMUNICATION**    
- [DS.5]†  The student will use storytelling as a strategy to effectively communicate with data.

- [DS.6]†  The student will justify the design, use and effectiveness of different forms of data visualizations.

**DATA MODELING**  
- [DS.7]  The student will be able to assess reliability and validity of source data in preparation for mathematical modeling.

- [DS.8]†  The student will be able to acquire and prepare big data sets for modeling and analysis.

- [DS.9]†  The student will select and analyze data models to make predictions, while assessing accuracy and sources of uncertainty.

- [DS.10]†  The student will be able to summarize and interpret data represented in both conventional and emerging visualizations.

- [DS.11]  The student will use hypothesis formulation and testing to extract actionable knowledge directly from data.

**DATA AND COMPUTING**  
- [DS.12]†  The student will be able to select and utilize appropriate technological tools and functions within those tools to process and prepare data for analysis.

- [DS.13]†  The student will be able to select and utilize appropriate technological tools and functions within those tools to analyze and communicate data effectively.

### Assessments

| Component   | Weight | Description |
| ----------- | :-----------: | :----------- |
| HOMEWORK      | 35%       | 6 take-home assignments |
| QUIZZES      | 20%       | 2 multiple choice quizzes consisting of high-level questions. |
| PROJECT      | 40%       | End-to-end data science team project with deliverables throughout semester. |
| JOURNALING      | 5%       | Write weekly journal entries responding to questions. Submitted every three weeks over the semester. |


### Delivery

- First class in week can generally be code demos, lecture content, and discussion
- Second class in week can be practice, workshop, work on team projects
- Nearly all course content is in Jupyter Notebooks
- For testing out Python script development, Spyder is one option

### Project

- Students encouraged to select a project from local community open data source  
- Students work in teams of 2-3
- Small checkpoint exercises with binary scoring (full credit for submitting, else no credit).  
  Aligns with course content.
- Runs for full duration of course
- Final project deliverables consist of:  
  - giving presentation to class 
  - discussion of team project 
  - submitting all cleaned, commented code
  
### BEFORE THE COURSE BEGINS
  
- Since some classrooms might not have fast internet connectivity, it is recommended that students are asked to Download and Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) before the course begins

- For keeping files organized, it is recommended that students create a course folder on their computer. The `datasets` folder can be saved within this folder.
