### SEMESTER 1
### WEEK 13-14
### TOPIC: 
- Building a linear regression model
- Evaluating model fit
- Avoiding use of predictors that could introduce bias into model

---  

#### LEARNING OUTCOMES
- Identify variables that should not be used as predictors as they would introduce bias into the model
- Understand why a model is trained on a portion of the data
- Introduce some basic functionality of the sklearn package
- Illustrate how to fit a linear regression model with sklearn
- Compare the fit of two linear regression models using their fit statistics

#### DELIVERABLES
- Students complete IDS_hw6_sklearn
- Submit project task

#### AGENDA
- Review lecture notes: sklearn_and_linear_regression.ipynb

For the second meeting in the week, students can work on their team projects, applying what they learned.
